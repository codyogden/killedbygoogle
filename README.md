## Contribute

To add a product, add it to `graveyard.json` file. You'll need the following information:

- Name of Product (`name`)
- Launch Date (`dateOpen`)
- Discontinued Date (`dateClose`)
- Description (`description`)
- Link (`link`)

The object should be appended to `graveyard.json` in the following format (note the alphabetical order of keys):

```
  {
    "dateClose": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "dateOpen": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "description": "[Product Name] was a single sentence overview of the product or service.",
    "link": "https://any.link-to-a.source/will/work-and-wikipedia-is-cool",
    "name": "[Product Name]"
  }
```

For code contributions outside of `graveyard.json`, check out the [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Description
The description should be a single sentence describing the product. It should begin with the products name. For example, "Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator." It will be attached to a generated sentence like "Killed about 5 years ago, Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator."

Please be respectful, only use past tense.

### Link
Link should be a resource that mentions the discontinuation date and talks about the product. Wikipedia is perfect.
